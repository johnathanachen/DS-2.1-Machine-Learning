# DS 2.1 Machine Learning

## Course Description

Students will learn the foundational concepts and techniques of machine learning and how to apply those techniques to data science. Principles of data science and machine learning will be examined and applied to problem solving.  Students will master data science processes and its applications, including how to wrangle and use data to train classification or prediction models. To demonstrate mastery, students will apply these techniques to develop and train models on data sets using industry-standard modern software libraries and tools. Students will develop “sharp” data science questions, select a data set and apply a variety of methods to explore those questions and find relevant answers.

## Class Assignments [Remove header if you like]
- List (with links) of all course-level assignments (i.e. tutorials, challenge sets, contractor project, custom projects, etc)
- Under each assignment link the rubric used to evaluate it or describe how it is evaluated.
- Projects should be linked to a project page which has a description & requirements.

### Tutorials
[REWORD AS RELEVANT TO YOUR COURSE] Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  They are graded on completion only.

- [Do Cool Stuff Tutorial]()

### Projects
[REWORD AS RELEVANT TO YOUR COURSE] Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.
- [Sample Project](Sample_Project.md)
    -   [Sample Project Rubric](Sample_Rubric.md)

### Other Class assignments

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Pass all required tutorials and projects (see associated rubrics)
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
 Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions: classes, huddles, etc. and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.
